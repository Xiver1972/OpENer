This library was included at the last minute because the license on some other software
stipulates that it cannot be combined with viral-licensed (GPL) software. The sprintf
I was using was derived from Linux's printk, so I had to real quick find something else.

The original source (printf-stdarg.c) was downloaded from:
http://www.menie.org/georges/embedded/index.html

The accompanying files are licensed under the LGPL v2. A copy of that license is included here.

Thanks to Georges Menie and Christian Ettinger.
